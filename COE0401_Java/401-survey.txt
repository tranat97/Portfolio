UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH FALL 2016 CS/COE 401 
--------------------------------------------------------
I have done some non trivial programming in the following programming languages:

[  ] NONE

[  ] JAVA  

[ x ] C

[ x ] C++

[  ] FORTRAN

[  ] PASCAL

[  ] PHP

[ x ] PYTHON

[  ] PERL

[  ] RUBY

[  ] BASH or SH or CSH or KORN etc

[ x ] MATLAB

[  ] VISUAL BASIC



List any computer science courses you have taken in High School/College/Tech School etc.


1) Robotics


2) ENGR 0011/0012



I understand these concepts from arithmetic:

[ x ] arithmetic operators  + - / *

[ x ] precedence of operations

[ x ] boolean logic  AND NOT OR XOR




I understand these concepts from set theory:

[ ] union, intersection

[ ] set difference

[ ] XOR

[ ] cardinality, membership


I understand the following programming fairly well:

[ x ] a variable

[ x ] data types such as integer flaoting point string boolean

[ x ] an if else statement

[ x ] iteration & loops  such as while loop, for loop, do loop

[ ] method/functions/subroutines

[ x ] passing parameters and return values

[ x ] arrays

[ x ] reading writing files

[ ] recursion

[ ] backtracking

[ ] dynamic programming


It has been this long since I have written a non trivial program

[ ] Never wrote any programs

[ x ] more than a couple months

[ ] over a year

[ ] a few years



I have heard that this course is:

[ ] very easy 

[ ] moderately easy

[ ] hard

[ ] extremely hard

[ x ] heard nothing about it / no idea
